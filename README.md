Hi! Welcome to my github page. My name's Cole and I graduated from the University of California, Riverside with a degree in Computer Science. I have a strong foundation in programming with languages like C++, Python, and Java. Additionally, I have experience working with and picking up various frameworks and technologies. I love new opportunities and strive to expand my skill set. My primary focus is software engineering, but I have an interest in full-stack development, as well. Feel free to explore my projects and repositories as a showcase of my skills.
